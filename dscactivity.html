<h1 style=color:black;background-color:brown;>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>I am Parvathi Vinod. I am a 2nd year, Electronics and Biomedical 
Engineering student at Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara.</p>

<p>I enjoy reading, writing and singing. I also like to speak about topics
I feel strongly about like Climate Change and Inequality in all its forms.
Some people think I should try debating but I don't think I know enough to
actually go for debating and as you can see I also overshare sometimes 
when it comes to my things but I can keep a secret for years if it is 
somebody else's. </p>

<p>So I guess that's enough self intro for today :) </p>
